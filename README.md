F7E MIDNIGHT UI


SUMMARY

A multimedia sharing platform allowing artists to host and showcase their work and link to their sites using modular, customizable homepages.

Open Project Collab Boards allow creators to host open source projects, or those seeking credit or experience to contribute to open, collaborative works one asset at a time.


FEATURES


Hosting:

Media is uploaded to host sites and URLs (YouTube, Imgur, etc.) are stored in Firebase using React APIs, then displayed as links or content modules on creator homepages. 


Creator Pages:

React/JS content module APIs designed to draw from specified cloud storage/filehosts.

Homepage layouts are saved to Firebase in JSON format, but can be downloaded clientside.

Creators select whether their content is available for download. Downloaded content takes priority when loading content pages or modules


Content Modules:

Modules should be drag-and-drop, resizable, and themed - either individually or to fit the userâ€™s chosen client window theme.

Platform:

Platform/UI themes are created to fit a monthly artistic theme. These client window themes are then archived and made downloadable.


Open Projects:

A categorized list of open-source assets and projects under development - a first-come-first-serve way to get some experience, credit, or free labor.

Post a project, list your project and assets with percent finished, and vet submissions to complete it with a little help from the community.

All credit where credit is due, and no money changes hands through the platform (as per explicitly stated rules.)
